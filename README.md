# Globe-Trotter
This project builds a trip planner application using Spring Boot for backend development, Thymeleaf for templating, and MongoDB for data persistence. It allows users to manage trip details, including destinations, itineraries, and other travel information. It is serving as a practical application of the concepts I am learning in my web server programming course, this 2023/24 Spring semester.

## Technologies Used
1. Spring Boot: Provides a streamlined framework for efficient backend development.
2. Thymeleaf: Offers a dynamic templating engine for crafting a user-friendly interface.
3. MongoDB: Functions as a flexible NoSQL database for storing and managing trip data.

## Benefits for Learning:
This project offers me hands-on experience with knowledge on:

1. Building RESTful APIs with Spring Boot
2. Designing user interfaces with Thymeleaf templates
3. Implementing data persistence using MongoDB


## Prerequisites:
1. Java 11 or later
2. Maven build tool
3. MongoDB installed on your local machine

## Installation:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Update `application.properties` with your MongoDB connection details (host, port, database name).
4. Run `mvn clean install`.
The app will run on the default port (usually 8080). You can verify this in the console output.


## Further Development:
I intend to implement the following functionalities as I learn more.

1. Implement user authentication and authorization for secure access.
2. Integrate with external services like travel booking platforms or weather APIs.

The project is currently being hosted on AWS Elastic BeanStalk here(http://globetrotter.eu-north-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/).
