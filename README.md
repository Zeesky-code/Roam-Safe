# Roam Safe
A web-based platform that protects travelers and international students from common scams by providing verified warnings, community-reported incidents, and smart safety tips â€” starting with cities like Istanbul. Built using Spring Boot for backend development, Thymeleaf for templating, and PostgreSQL for data persistence. This project serves as a practical application of the concepts I am learning in my web server programming course, this 2023/24 Spring semester.

## Technologies Used
1. Spring Boot: Provides a streamlined framework for efficient backend development.
2. Thymeleaf: Offers a dynamic templating engine for crafting a user-friendly interface.
3. PostgreSQL: Functions as a robust relational database for storing and managing trip data.

## Benefits for Learning:
This project offers me hands-on experience with knowledge on:

1. Building RESTful APIs with Spring Boot
2. Designing user interfaces with Thymeleaf templates
3. Implementing data persistence using MongoDB


## Prerequisites:
1. Java 11 or later
2. Maven build tool
3. PostgreSQL installed on your local machine

## Installation:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Update `application.properties` with your PostgreSQL connection details (host, port, database name).
4. Run `mvn clean install`.
The app will run on the default port (usually 8080). You can verify this in the console output.


## Further Development:
I intend to implement the following functionalities as I learn more.

1. Implement user authentication and authorization for secure access.
2. Add more cities and expand the safety database.
3. Integrate with local law enforcement APIs for real-time incident reporting.
4. Develop a mobile app for on-the-go safety alerts.
